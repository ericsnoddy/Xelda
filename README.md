RPG clon, intro to pygame

This is my version of a Pygame tutorial RPG. My comments are verbose for learning
purposes, pardon the clutter. I plan on getting more comfortable with classes and 
OOP, the ins and outs of passing vars, functions and heritance. Learning about 
animation and sprite/particle manipulation. Setting up a "camera" for a topdown 
scroller. Working with nested dictionaries/lists. Defining hitboxes and checking 
collisions. Populating the land with Tiles (via Tiled level editor). And refining 
the code for playability/response (eg, fix clunky world movement).
UPDATE: Skipping refinements as I think I've gotten what I wanted out of this demo.

CONTROLS (editable in settings.py):

ARROW keys for movement and selection

Q to cycle magic

E to cycle weapon

SPACE to attack and to select upgrade

LCONTROL to cast spell

TAB to pause or upgrade player
