Zelda clone, intro to pygame

This is my version of a Pygame tutorial RPG. I plan on getting more comfortable
with classes and OOP, the ins and outs of passing vars, functions and heritance.
Learning about animation and sprite/particle manipulation. Setting up a "camera" 
for a topdown scroller. Working with nested dictionaries/lists. Defining hitboxes
and checking collisions. Populating the land with Tiles (via Tiled level editor).
And refining the code for playability/response (eg, fix clunky world movement).

UPDATE: Skipping refinements as I've gotten what I wanted out of this demo.

CONTROLS (editable in settings.py):

arrow keys for movement and selection

q to cycle magic

e to cycle weapon

space to attack and to select upgrade

left control to cast spell
